Titanium strikes the perfect balance between weight, ruggedness, and corrosion resistance. The case rises up to surround the flat sapphire crystal and protect it from edge impacts. The Digital Crown is larger and the side button is raised from the case, making them easier to use while you're wearing gloves.`,
